The Eucalyptus Production Operations Guide

I. Introduction.
    A. Why is this needed? (Because clouds are complex and interdependent.)
    B. Who is the audience? (Admins.)
    C. When should you read this? (When you're ready to run a cloud in production.)
    D. What are the assumptions?  (Full component separation, config mgmt, monitoring.)

II. Pre-Production: Laying the Foundation.
    A. For five nines at the cloud level, build five nines beneath.
    B. Reviewing the reference architectures.
        1. A brief overview of what the components do. 
        2. A brief overview of capacity planning.
        3. Pointers to reference architectures.
    C. Building your storage strategy.
        1. The difference between OSG/S3 and EBS.
        2. The importance of a SAN for heavy EBS usage.
           a. Steal Zach's email from 3/4/14: "Storage Controller - Main Bottlenecks?"
        3. The importance of a gateway for heavy S3 usage.
    D. Building your network strategy.
        1. Reviewing the network modes and what features are needed in each.
